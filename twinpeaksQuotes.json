Explain to me exactly what Dougie did to make him owe you money.\nJimmy: He borrowed it.\nJaney-E Jones: What do you mean, \"he borrowed it\"?\nTommy: He took points on a football game.  He got greedy, he doubled down. It didn't work out for him. Out 20 grand he was, plus interest. Now, that was three weeks ago.\nJimmy: Meter's still running. It's up to 52.\nJaney-E Jones: So let me get this straight. People were playing games. He made a bet where he lost $20,000. But you want him to pay you back $52,000?\nTommy: Very good. That's correct.\nJanie-E Jones: Okay, so you get this straight. My husband has a job, he has a wife, he has a child, he does not make enough money to pay back $52,000 for anything. We are not wealthy people. We drive cheap, terrible cars. We are the 99 percenters. And we are shit on enough, and we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.\nJimmy: Nevertheless, lady...\nJaney-E Jones: So here's what we're gonna do. Without my knowledge, my husband came to you for a loan of $20,000. You were nice enough to give it to him. But he should never have been gambling like that. I'm gonna pay you back. Now, at my bank, where we make less than one percent interest on what little money we have, people would be turning cartwheels just to get 25 percent interest on any loan, and that is what I'm generously gonna give to you right now, $25,000. That is my first, last, and only offer to you. What kind of world are we living in where people can behave like this? Treat other people this way without any compassion or feeling for their suffering? We are living in a dark, dark age, and you are part of the problem.
